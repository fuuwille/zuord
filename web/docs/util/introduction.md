# Zuord Util Introduction

**Zuord Util** is a robust collection of advanced TypeScript utility types designed to simplify complex type operations and enhance type safety in your projects. It builds on the foundational primitives provided by @zuord/type and serves as a logical layer that powers core features of the main zuord system.

## Purpose

This utility set aims to make TypeScript's static typing system more expressive and flexible by offering modular, composable types that cover common and advanced use cases. Whether you need to verify type equality, check assignability, include or exclude specific properties, or operate on tuples of types, Zuord Util provides precise and performant solutions that form the backbone of Zuord's type-level logic.

## Main Categories

- [Eq](../util/types/eq) — Exact type equality checks, including comparisons over tuples.  
- [Is](../util/types/is) — Type compatibility and assignability checks.  
- [Has](../util/types/has) — Property existence and key containment checks.  
- [Exclude](../util/types/exclude) — Removing types or properties from other types.  
- [Extract](../util/types/extract) — Selecting matching types or properties from source types.

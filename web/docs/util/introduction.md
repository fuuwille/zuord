## Purpose

It aims to reduce code duplication, standardize common type checks, and enable writing more readable and maintainable code. By simplifying complex type manipulations, it helps developers increase productivity and ensure type safety throughout their projects.

## Main Categories

- [Is](../util/types/is) — Type compatibility and assignability checks.  
- [Has](../util/types/has) — Property existence and key containment checks.  
- [Exclude](../util/types/exclude) — Removing types or properties from other types.  
- [Extract](../util/types/extract) — Selecting matching types or properties from source types.

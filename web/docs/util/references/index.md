# Utility References

This section provides detailed documentation for the utility types included in the `@zuord/util` package. These types form the logical foundation of the Zuord system, enabling powerful type-level operations such as comparison, validation, filtering, and structural reasoning.

Each utility type is presented with its type signature, behavior, constraints, and usage examples.

## Included Utilities

- [`Eq<T1, T2>`](./eq): Compile-time type equality checker
- [`Is<T, Pattern>`](./is): Pattern-based type matching
- [`Has<T, Key>`](./has): Property existence and structural validation

> These utilities are designed to be modular and composable. They work in harmony with the core normalization system to simplify complex type logic.

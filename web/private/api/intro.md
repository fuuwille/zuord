## Features

Zuord offers practical and reliable tools to make your development experience smoother, safer, and more efficient — especially when working with TypeScript.

- **Type safety:**  
  Helps you catch mistakes before they happen by using the power of TypeScript’s type system. You can trust that your types behave the way you expect — at compile time.

- **High performance:**  
  Built with performance in mind. Most utilities work entirely at the type level or with minimal runtime logic, meaning no unnecessary slowdowns in your app.

- **Seamless integration:**  
  You can start using Zuord Util right away — no setup needed. It fits naturally into any TypeScript or JavaScript project and plays well with popular frameworks.

- **Improves code quality:**  
  Makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain by reducing repetition and encouraging consistent, well-structured patterns.

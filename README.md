# Zuord

**Zuord** (German for 'assign' or 'map') is a TypeScript library for deep object manipulations and type inferences, fully synchronizing runtime functions with compile-time types.

<br/>

> *"Zuord starts where other libraries set their limits. With its schema-less architecture, it provides practical solutions to complex problems that many existing tools struggle with. In terms of performance, type inference, and usability, it technically outshines most of its competitors."*

## ðŸš§ Early Access Notice

Zuord is currently in an **early access** phase. While the foundations are solid, the API is still evolving and **not stable**.

At this stage, **contributions are not being accepted**, unless explicitly stated otherwise.  
However, **feedback, suggestions, and issue reports are highly welcome** and will be taken into consideration with great care.

If you're passionate about TypeScript's type system and want to explore its limits â€” now is the perfect time to get involved.

# Overview

Zuord is the most powerful utility type system designed to fill critical gaps in the TypeScript ecosystem.  
It enables precise compile-time type differentiation and normalization to enhance type safety and developer experience.

---

## Key Features

- **Advanced Normalization:** Streamlines complex types into clean, optimized forms.  
- **Class vs. Plain Object Differentiation:** Accurately distinguishes between class instances and plain objects.  
- **Robust Utility Types:** Includes essential helpers like `Eq`, `Is`, `Has`, `Exclude`, and `Extract` for expressive and precise type logic.

## Installation

```bash
npm install zuord@0.1.0-alpha
```

# Samples

Let's merge several plain objects and observe how the compiler infers the resulting type.

```typescript
const mergedObject = zuord.merge(
  { hahah: 1, b: 2, hello: { a: {a : new Date()}, b: 2 }, cici: [[[true]], ["stringg"]]},
  { hahah: "falsseeee", c: 4 },
  { b: 5, d: 6, hello: { a: {b: "s"}, c: 4 } },
  { hahah: () => null },
  { hahah: "string", cici: [[1, 2, [3, 2]], ["cici", 3]] }
);
```

In the TypeScript ecosystem, most popular libraries either leave the merged object's type as any or provide limited type inference.
Zuord, however, offers natural and precise type inference without compromising performance.

The result:

```typescript
const mergedObject: {
    hahah: string;
    b: number;
    hello: {
        a: {
            a: Date;
            b: string;
        };
        b: number;
        c: number;
    };
    cici: (string | number | (number | boolean)[])[][];
    c: number;
    d: number;
}
```

As demonstrated, types are inferred naturally without requiring explicit schemas.

# Zuord Library

# Library

Zuord provides a modern **TypeScript-first** library for producing new entities from existing ones. It offers a variety of producers usable both at **runtime** and at the **type-level**, forming a **synchronized API** across both.

Unlike other libraries, Zuord delivers a smooth and predictable experience, always matching the function's return type.

:::note
In Zuord, all producers operate across **all nested levels of objects**. Each can be **configured** with preset modes, which in turn affects their **operational behavior** and **type inference**.

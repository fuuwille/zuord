# Zuord Library

Zuord provides a modern **TypeScript-first** library for producing new entities from existing ones. It offers a variety of producers usable both at runtime and at the type-level, forming a **synchronized API** across both.

:::note
In Zuord, all producers are **recursive by default** and operate across **all levels of objects**. Each can be **configured** with preset modes, which in turn affects their **operational behavior** and **type inference**.

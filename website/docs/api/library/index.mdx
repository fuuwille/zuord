# Zuord Library

Zuord provides a modern **TypeScript-first** library for producing new entities from existing ones. It offers a variety of producers usable both at runtime and at the type-level, forming a **synchronized API** across both.

Unlike other libraries, Zuord delivers a smooth and predictable experience, always matching the function's return type.

:::note
In Zuord, all producers are **recursive by default** and operate across **all levels of objects**. Each can be **configured** with preset modes, which in turn affects their **operational behavior** and **type inference**.

## Namespaces

Depending on your usage scenarios, you can use one of two types of namespaces:

| Namespace | Description | Imports |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| [Zuord](/docs/api/library/zuord) | General users, fast and simple functionality. | |
| ZuordX | Advanced users, full control and customization. | |

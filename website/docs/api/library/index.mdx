# Zuord Library

# Zuord

Zuord is a modern **TypeScript-first** library for producing new entities from existing ones. It offers a variety of producers to suit your needs, usable both at runtime and at the type level. This provides a **synchronized** runtime and type-level API.

Unlike other libraries, Zuord provides a smooth, predictable experience that matches the type returned by the function.

## Available APIs

- [integrate](./integrate)
- [merge](./merge)
- [evolve](./evolve)
- [omit](./omit)
- [pick](./pick)

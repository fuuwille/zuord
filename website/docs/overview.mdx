# Zuord

Zuord is built around a main library for producing objects, with additional packages that provide type safety, useful utilities, and more.

## Zuord Says: Type-First, Then Runtime

## Zuord Library

Zuord provides a modern **TypeScript-first** library that allows you to produce new type-safe objects from existing ones.
